# Cable Management

This repository contains parts for running cable around the wall of a living room for discrete hi-fi installations.

## Motivation

I previously used white boxing/conduit and found it ugly and hard to manage.

## Parts Required

- 2x M3 counter-sunk wood screws for attaching the wall bracket.
- 2x M3 counter-sunk 10mm for attaching wood panel.
- Suitable LED tape if desired.

## Instructions

### Wall Flange

The wall flange can be used for passing cables through a wall. Firstly cut a hole in the wall, then install the flange. One piece goes at each end. You might like to glue the parts together.

### Wall Boxing

The wall boxing comes in two parts, a piece which is attached directly to the wall and a piece which is attached to a wooden cover. The size of the cover plate in the included parts is 8cm x 1cm thick. You'd get this cut for the required/desired length.
